# Optimization of the ISEN Distribution Project

This project focuses on optimizing the ISEN (Institut Supérieur de l'Électronique et du Numérique) distribution system. It involves data scraping from an .xlsx file using Python, generating .txt and .lp files, and includes an application to create a PDF containing project details.

## Overview

The project comprises several components:

1. **Data Scraping:** Python scripts are utilized to extract relevant data from an .xlsx file related to the ISEN distribution system.

2. **File Generation:**
    - **.txt File:** Data scraped from the .xlsx file is transformed and saved into a .txt file for further processing.
    - **.lp File:** Another file, formatted as a .lp file, is generated using the extracted data. This file might serve as input for optimization algorithms.

3. **PDF Generation Application:** An application is built using Python to generate a detailed PDF document. This PDF contains comprehensive project details and inputs for a specific ISEN distribution project.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python:** Used extensively for data scraping, file handling, and application development.
- **Libraries and Modules:** Potentially employed libraries such as `pandas` for data manipulation, `openpyxl` for handling .xlsx files, and `reportlab` for PDF generation.
- **Optimization Algorithms:** Algorithms might be integrated into the .lp file generation, depending on project requirements.


## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ISEN-distribution-optimization.git
    cd ISEN-distribution-optimization
    ```

2. **Setup:**
    - Ensure Python and necessary libraries are installed.
    - Install required libraries:
      ```bash
      pip install pandas openpyxl reportlab random2 pyinstaller
      ```

3. **Run the Scripts:**
    - Execute the Python scripts for data scraping, file generation, and PDF creation.

4. **Explore Generated Files:**
    - Check the `scrapping` directory for the generated .txt and .lp files.
    - Find the PDF with project details in the `pdf` directory.
